# DCS-SEPECAT-Jaguar

This is a conversion of the [FlightGear Jaguar GR1](https://github.com/Zaretto/Jaguar-GR1) to DCS world. It is a full fidelity highly detailed aerodynamic model with an [EFM built using acEFM](https://github.com/Zaretto/acEFM)

# Aerodynamic model

The aerodynamic model has been build using VSPAERO.

Aircraft origin for measurements is the nose

A joint Anglo-French programme serving with the French and Indian air forces as well as the RAF the Jaguar tactical support and ground-attack aircraft equipped eight first-line squadrons from 1974 and was a major element in RAF Germany’s Cold-War era air capability until supplanted by the Tornado in 1985.

Of 400 Jaguars built 203 were delivered to the RAF. Jaguars of the Coltishall Strike Wing performed sterling work in the Gulf War of 1991 destroying Iraqi artillery and missile positions during Operation Desert Storm.

RAF Jaguars were finally retired in April 2007 two years after their French air force counterparts were retired.  A number of Jaguars still remain in use for technical training at RAF Cosford where a few remained in taxiable condition for teaching aircraft handling until 2016.
