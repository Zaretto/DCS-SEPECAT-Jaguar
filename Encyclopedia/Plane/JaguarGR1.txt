Type History

The Jaguar was developed jointly by Great Britain and France who were
looking for an advanced trainer. Sepecat was the company formed by BAC
and Breguet to develop the trainer. However, a change of requirement
saw both countries develop the Jaguar as a tactical strike aircraft,
each country receiving 200 aircraft which included a number of
trainers. The French prototype flew in September 1968 and the British
one in October 1969. The Jaguar GR1 entered RAF service in March 1974
and took over the ground attack role from the RAF Phantoms. Eventually
it served with three squadrons at Coltishall and five in RAF
Germany. Those in Germany were replaced by Tornadoes from June 1984.

The home based squadrons saw action in the First Gulf War of 1991
where the Jaguars operated at medium levels instead of their usual low
level attacks. Later they saw action in the Balkans and Iraq. Due to
their operational success it was decided to upgrade the aircraft to
GR3’s over the next few years, giving them day and night
capability. Having spent the money they were then withdrawn from
service early to save money under Defence Cuts! Instead of ending up
on the scrapheap, many of the Jaguars continued in use with the RAF as
instructional airframes, their flying role taken over by Typhoons. In
all the RAF received 165 Jaguar GR1’s and forty of the T2 trainer
version.

BAC and Sepecat developed the Jaguar International in 1976 which
resulted in export sales to Ecuador, Nigeria and Oman. Only Oman was
to make any real use of them. More important was the sale of forty to
India in 1978 with production then being undertaken by Hindustan
Aeronautics in India. Low rate production continued until 2012 — five
years after the RAF withdrew them from active service. The French Air
Force received 160 Jaguar A’s (Attaque) and 40 Jaguar E’s
(Entraineur), being fitted with French guns and missiles. They
equipped six squadrons, first seeing action in Mauritania in December
1977. Various conflicts in other parts of Africa — including Chad and
the Central African Republic — saw French aircraft based there until
1991. The French aircraft also took part in the First Gulf War and the
Balkans. The Jaguar continued in French service until July 2005, when
their role was taken over by Mirage 2000s.
